            <h1>What is a moon? How many moons are here in our Solar System? Know the differences and get to know some
                more intresting of them.</h1>

            <p>The Solar System's eight planets, and its nine most likely dwarf planets, are known to be orbited by at
                least 297 natural satellites, or moons. At least 20 of them are large enough to be gravitationally
                rounded; of these, all are covered by a crust of ice except for Earth's Moon and Jupiter's Io.[1]
                Several of the largest ones are in hydrostatic equilibrium and would therefore be considered dwarf
                planets or planets if they were in direct orbit around the Sun and not in their current states (orbiting
                planets or dwarf planets).</p>

                        <p>Titan is the largest moon of Saturn, the second-largest in the Solar System and larger than
                            any
                            of the dwarf planets of the Solar System. It is the only moon known to have a dense
                            atmosphere,
                            and is the only known object in space other than Earth on which clear evidence of stable
                            bodies
                            of surface liquid has been found.</p>

                        <p>Ganymede, or Jupiter III, is the largest and most massive natural satellite of Jupiter as
                            well as
                            in the Solar System, being a planetary-mass moon. It is the largest Solar System object
                            without
                            an atmosphere, despite being the only moon of the Solar System with a magnetic field. Like
                            Titan, it is larger than the planet Mercury, but has somewhat less surface gravity than
                            Mercury,
                            Io or the Moon.</p>

                        <p>Triton is the largest natural satellite of the planet Neptune, and was the first Neptunian
                            moon
                            to be discovered, on October 11, 1846, by English astronomer William Lassell. It is the only
                            large moon in the Solar System with a retrograde orbit, an orbit in the direction opposite
                            to
                            its planet's rotation.[3][12] Because of its retrograde orbit and composition similar to
                            Pluto,
                            Triton is thought to have been a dwarf planet, captured from the Kuiper belt.</p>

                        <h2>Enceladus</h2>

                        <p>Enceladus is the sixth-largest moon of Saturn (19th largest in the Solar System). It is about
                            500
                            kilometers (310 miles) in diameter,[5] about a tenth of that of Saturn's largest moon,
                            Titan.
                            Enceladus is mostly covered by fresh, clean ice, making it one of the most reflective bodies
                            of
                            the Solar System. Consequently, its surface temperature at noon only reaches −198 °C (75.1
                            K;
                            −324.4 °F), far colder than a light-absorbing body would be. Despite its small size,
                            Enceladus
                            has a wide range of surface features, ranging from old, heavily cratered regions to young,
                            tectonically deformed terrain. Enceladus was discovered on August 28, 1789, by William
                            Herschel,[1][17][18] but little was known about it until the two Voyager spacecraft, Voyager
                            1
                            and Voyager 2, flew by Saturn in 1980 and 1981.[19] In 2005, the spacecraft Cassini started
                            multiple close flybys of Enceladus, revealing its surface and environment in greater detail.
                            In
                            particular, Cassini discovered water-rich plumes venting from the south polar region.[20]
                            Cryovolcanoes near the south pole shoot geyser-like jets of water vapor, molecular hydrogen,
                            other volatiles, and solid material, including sodium chloride crystals and ice particles,
                            into
                            space, totaling about 200 kilograms (440 pounds) per second.[15][19][21] More than 100
                            geysers
                            have been identified.</p>

                        <h2>Io</h2>

                        <p>Io (/ˈaɪ.oʊ/), or Jupiter I, is the innermost and third-largest of the four Galilean moons of
                            the
                            planet Jupiter. Slightly larger than Earth’s moon, Io is the fourth-largest moon in the
                            Solar
                            System, has the highest density of any moon, the strongest surface gravity of any moon, and
                            the
                            lowest amount of water (by atomic ratio) of any known astronomical object in the Solar
                            System.
                            It was discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and was named after the mythological character
                            Io,
                            a priestess of Hera who became one of Zeus's lovers. With over 400 active volcanoes, Io is
                            the
                            most geologically active object in the Solar System.[11][12][13] This extreme geologic
                            activity
                            is the result of tidal heating from friction generated within Io's interior as it is pulled
                            between Jupiter and the other Galilean moons—Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. Several
                            volcanoes
                            produce plumes of sulfur and sulfur dioxide that climb as high as 500 km (300 mi) above the
                            surface. Io's surface is also dotted with more than 100 mountains that have been uplifted by
                            extensive compression at the base of Io's silicate crust. Some of these peaks are taller
                            than
                            Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth's surface.[14] Unlike most moons in the outer
                            Solar
                            System, which are mostly composed of water ice, Io is primarily composed of silicate rock
                            surrounding a molten iron or iron sulfide core. Most of Io's surface is composed of
                            extensive
                            plains with a frosty coating of sulfur and sulfur dioxide. Io's volcanism is responsible for
                            many of its unique features. Its volcanic plumes and lava flows produce large surface
                            changes
                            and paint the surface in various subtle shades of yellow, red, white, black, and green,
                            largely
                            due to allotropes and compounds of sulfur. Numerous extensive lava flows, several more than
                            500
                            km (300 mi) in length, also mark the surface. The materials produced by this volcanism make
                            up
                            Io's thin, patchy atmosphere and Jupiter's extensive magnetosphere. Io's volcanic ejecta
                            also
                            produce a large plasma torus around Jupiter.</p>
